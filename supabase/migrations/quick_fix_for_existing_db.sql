  # Quick Fix for Your Current Database Setup
  
  This addresses your exact situation:
  - You have a list_memberships table with recipient_id 
  - You have a subscribers table already  
  - You don't have a recipients table
  - You just need to fix the relationship
*/

-- Step 1: Check current state
SELECT 'Current database state:' as info;

SELECT 
  t.table_name,
  array_agg(c.column_name ORDER BY c.ordinal_position) as columns
FROM information_schema.tables t
JOIN information_schema.columns c ON t.table_name = c.table_name
WHERE t.table_name IN ('list_memberships', 'subscribers', 'recipients')
AND t.table_schema = 'public'
GROUP BY t.table_name;

-- Step 2: Add subscriber_id column to list_memberships if it doesn't exist
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
                WHERE table_name = 'list_memberships' 
                AND column_name = 'subscriber_id' 
                AND table_schema = 'public') THEN
    ALTER TABLE list_memberships ADD COLUMN subscriber_id uuid;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Added subscriber_id column to list_memberships';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'subscriber_id column already exists in list_memberships';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Step 3: Since you don't have recipients table, let's clear the problematic data
-- and let you start fresh with proper relationships
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- Clear existing list_memberships since we can't migrate the recipient_id relationships
  DELETE FROM list_memberships;

    -- Drop any foreign key constraints on recipient_id first
    DECLARE

    ALTER TABLE list_memberships DROP COLUMN recipient_id;

  END IF;
END $$;

-- Step 4: Add proper foreign key constraint for subscriber_id
DO $$

    FOREIGN KEY (subscriber_id) REFERENCES subscribers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Added foreign key constraint: list_memberships.subscriber_id -> subscribers.id';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'Foreign key constraint already exists';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Step 5: Make subscriber_id NOT NULL and add unique constraint
ALTER TABLE list_memberships ALTER COLUMN subscriber_id SET NOT NULL;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS list_memberships_unique_subscription 
ON list_memberships(list_id, subscriber_id);

-- Step 6: Ensure proper indexes exist
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS list_memberships_list_id_idx ON list_memberships(list_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS list_memberships_subscriber_id_idx ON list_memberships(subscriber_id);

-- Step 7: Enable RLS if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE list_memberships ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 8: Create or replace RLS policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage own list memberships" ON list_memberships;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own list memberships"
  ON list_memberships FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM lists

      SELECT 1 FROM lists 
      WHERE lists.id = list_memberships.list_id 
      AND lists.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Step 9: Update or create the lists_with_counts view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS lists_with_counts CASCADE;
CREATE VIEW lists_with_counts AS
SELECT 
  l.*,
  COALESCE(member_counts.total_members, 0) as total_members,
  COALESCE(member_counts.subscribed_members, 0) as subscribed_members
FROM lists l
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT 
    lm.list_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_members,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN s.status = 'subscribed' THEN 1 END) as subscribed_members
  FROM list_memberships lm
  JOIN subscribers s ON s.id = lm.subscriber_id
  GROUP BY lm.list_id
) member_counts ON l.id = member_counts.list_id;

-- Step 10: Test the relationship (this should work now!)
SELECT 'Testing the relationship that was failing...' as test;

DO $$
DECLARE
  test_result TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Try the query that was failing before
  PERFORM lm.id, lm.added_at, s.id, s.email, s.first_name, s.last_name, s.status, s.created_at

  LIMIT 1;
  
  RAISE NOTICE '✅ SUCCESS: The relationship query works without errors!';
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN

-- Final verification

  'You can now add list memberships through your app interface.' as next_step;

-- Show current structure
SELECT 'Final table structure:' as info;
